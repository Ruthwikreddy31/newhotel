# ðŸš¨ URGENT: Missing Environment Variables

## The Issue
Your application is not working because it's missing the Supabase environment variables. The app can't connect to your database!

## ðŸ”§ **IMMEDIATE FIX REQUIRED**

### Step 1: Create Environment File
Create a file called `.env` in the `royal-hostel-hub-main` folder with this content:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
```

### Step 2: Get Your Supabase Credentials
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ API
4. Copy the following values:
   - **Project URL** â†’ Use for `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon public** key â†’ Use for `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### Step 3: Update the .env file
Replace the placeholder values with your actual Supabase credentials.

### Step 4: Restart the Dev Server
```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **Why This Happened**
- The app needs Supabase credentials to work
- Without them, authentication fails
- Users can't login or access dashboards

## âœ… **After Setup**
Once you add the environment variables:
1. The app will connect to your Supabase database
2. Users can sign up and login
3. Direct dashboard navigation will work
4. All features will be functional

## ðŸ†˜ **Need Help?**
If you don't have a Supabase project yet:
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Create a new project
3. Run the migration from `supabase/migrations/` folder
4. Get your credentials and add them to `.env`
