# ðŸš¨ QUICK FIX: App Not Working

## The Problem
Your app is running on http://localhost:8080 but it's not working because it's missing Supabase environment variables.

## ðŸ”§ **IMMEDIATE SOLUTION**

### 1. Create `.env` file
In the `royal-hostel-hub-main` folder, create a file called `.env` with this content:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-anon-key-here
```

### 2. Get Your Supabase Credentials
1. Go to https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project (or create one if you don't have it)
3. Go to **Settings** â†’ **API**
4. Copy:
   - **Project URL** â†’ Use for `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - **anon public** key â†’ Use for `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

### 3. Restart the Server
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
npm run dev
```

## ðŸŽ¯ **What This Fixes**
- âœ… App will connect to Supabase database
- âœ… Users can sign up and login
- âœ… Direct dashboard navigation will work
- âœ… All authentication features will function

## ðŸ†˜ **If You Don't Have Supabase Project**
1. Go to https://supabase.com
2. Click "Start your project"
3. Create a new project
4. Wait for it to finish setting up
5. Go to Settings â†’ API to get your credentials
6. Run the database migration from `supabase/migrations/` folder

## ðŸ“± **After Fix**
- Open http://localhost:8080
- You should see the Royal Hostel landing page
- Click on Customer/Worker/Manager to test signup
- Login should work and redirect to dashboards

**The app is ready - it just needs the database connection!**
